Create a GitHub repository that executes a workflow each time someone commits a change.

<ul>
  <li>some action is triggered once someone commits a change in the repository</li>
  <li>the GitHub repo link (and README.md file) gives sufficient explanation of what you're trying to achieve, your learning, the steps you take etc.</li>
</ul>
